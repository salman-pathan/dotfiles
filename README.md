## Introduction

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-y systems for customizing system settings. They are usually preceded by a dot (.) and are hidden by default. This repository contains my preferred configurations for various tools and applications.

## Configuration

You may need to install some dependencies for the configurations to work correctly. Here are some common dependencies:

1. `git`
2. `fish`
3. `starship`
4. `eza`
5. `zoxide`
6. `ripgrep`
7. `fzf`
8. `neovim`
9. `wezterm`
10. `Commit Mono Nerd Font`
